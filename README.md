### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Sahil. I'm making a career pivot to learn about building AI-powered products.

Currently, I'm building an LLM-powered web app for bipolar medication research at Code for Philly.

Previously, I spent 4+ years building ML model evaluation utilities for user-facing products at 
machine learning software startups and 7+ years researching and developing statistical methods 
to identify disease-associated genes during my PhD at Northwestern University.
